      "content": "There are several ways to express the moment capacity of a beam depending on the design code and whether you’re dealing with reinforced concrete or steel. Here are the common forms:\n\n### Reinforced concrete (flexural capacity from code-based approach)\nFor a singly reinforced concrete beam in bending, the nominal moment capacity is often given by\n\n$$M_n = C_f \\, A_s \\, f_y \\, d \\, \\phi,$$\n\nbut more practically, design (factored) moment capacity in many codes is expressed as\n\n$$M_u = \\phi \\, M_n = \\phi \\, A_s \\, f_y \\, (d - a/2),$$\n\nwhere\n- \\(A_s\\) = area of tensile reinforcement,\n- \\(f_y\\) = yield strength of reinforcement,\n- \\(d\\) = effective depth,\n- \\(a\\) = lever arm depth related to internal forces (often \\(a = \\beta_1 c\\) with neutral axis depth \\(c\\)),\n- \\(\\phi\\) = strength reduction factor (depends on code and whether tension-controlled, etc.).\n\nA more explicit common closed-form for a singly reinforced beam under flexure (balanced or tension-controlled) is\n\n$$M_u = \\phi \\, A_s f_y \\left( d - \\frac{a}{2} \\right),$$\n\nwith \\(a = \\beta_1 c\\) and \\(c\\) found from equilibrium using the stress block.\n\nFor typical concrete design (ACI 318, Eurocode 2), a practical expression is\n\n$$M_u = \\phi \\, C_f \\, A_s f_y \\left( d - \\frac{a}{2} \\right),$$\n\nwhere \\(a\\) is determined from the strain compatibility and stress block.\n\nIf you’re using the simple rectangular stress block (equivalent to \\(a = \\beta_1 c\\)) and assuming a balanced or tension-controlled section, you’ll often see\n\n$$M_u = \\phi \\, A_s f_y \\left( d - \\frac{A_s f_y}{2 b f_c'} \\right),$$\n\nwhere \\(b\\) is the beam width and \\(f_c'\\) is the compressive strength of concrete, though exact form depends on the code.\n\n### Steel beam (flexural capacity)\nFor a singly reinforced steel beam (or steel section) in plastic design,",
