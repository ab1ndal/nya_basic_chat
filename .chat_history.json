      "Dubai is in the Gulf Standard Time (GST) zone, which is UTC+4 hours.\n\nTo find the current time in Dubai, add 4 hours to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, if it is 12:00 noon UTC, it is 4:00 PM in Dubai.\n\n**Note:** Dubai does not observe daylight saving time, so this offset remains the same year-round.\n\nIf you tell me your current time or location, I can help you calculate the exact time in Dubai."
