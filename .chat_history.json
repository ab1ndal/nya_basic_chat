      "content": "Here’s a clear step-by-step method to calculate the nominal moment capacity of a singly reinforced rectangular concrete beam (tension steel only), per common design assumptions (Whitney stress block). Adjust material factors per your code (ACI/Eurocode/IS, etc.).\n\nGiven:\n- b = beam width\n- h = overall depth\n- d = effective depth to steel centroid\n- As = area of tensile steel\n- fc' = concrete compressive strength\n- fy = steel yield strength\n\nAssumptions:\n- Tension steel yields at ultimate (under-reinforced section)\n- Concrete in tension is neglected\n- Whitney rectangular stress block with stress = 0.85 fc' and depth a = β1 c\n- β1 per code (ACI: β1 = 0.85 for fc' ≤ 28 MPa, reduce by 0.05 per 7 MPa above to minimum 0.65)\n\nSteps:\n1) Check steel strain to confirm under-reinforced behavior\n   - Neutral axis depth: c = a/β1\n   - You can iterate or preliminarily assume yielding; verify εt ≥ code minimum (e.g., ≥ 0.005 in ACI). A quick check after getting a below.\n\n2) Force equilibrium (T = C) to find a\n   - Tension: T = As fy\n   - Compression: C = 0.85 fc' b a\n   - Solve for a:\n     a = As fy / (0.85 fc' b)\n\n3) Nominal moment capacity Mn about the tension steel level\n   - Internal lever arm: z = d − a/2\n   - Mn = T z = As fy (d − a/2)\n\n4) Design strength φMn\n   - Apply strength reduction factor φ per code (e.g., ACI: φ ≈ 0.9 if εt ≥ 0.005)\n   - φMn = φ As fy (d − a/2)\n\n5) Ductility/yield check (after computing a)\n   - c = a/β1\n   - Strain in tension steel: εt = (d − c)/c · εcu, with εcu ≈ 0.003 (ACI)\n   - Ensure εt ≥ code minimum for tension-controlled section; otherwise use transition φ.\n\nSpecial cases/limits:\n- Maximum As: ensure section is under-reinforced. Don’t exceed code maximum steel ratio ρmax for ductility.\n- Minimum As: check ρmin for crack control.\n- For high fc' adjust β1 as required by your code.\n- Units must be consistent.\n\nExample (brief):\n- b = 300 mm, d = 500 mm, fc' = 30 MPa, fy = 500 MPa, As = 2010 mm²\n- a = (2010×500)/(0.85×30×300) ≈ 131.3 mm\n- z = 500 − 131.3/",
